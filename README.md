# Football-Player-Position-Prediction-and-Performance-AnalysisðŸŽ¯âš½

This project aims to predict football player positions based on their attributes and analyze their performance using machine learning and data visualization techniques. The dataset includes player statistics such as technical skills, physical attributes, and overall performance metrics.
Overview
The primary goals of this project are to:
â€¢	Predict player positions based on their attributes (e.g., ball control, dribbling, aggression, etc.).
â€¢	Analyze player performance by evaluating key metrics and visualizing insights.
Dataset
â€¢	Source: The dataset from Kaggle
Visualizations
1.	Country Distribution: A bar chart showing the number of players from specific countries.
2.	Age, Height, and Weight Distributions: Histograms displaying the distribution of these physical attributes.
3.	Top 10 Clubs: A bar chart displaying the clubs with the most players.
4.	3D Scatter Plots: Visualizations of relationships between technical, defensive, and goalkeeping attributes.
5.	Correlation Heatmap: A heatmap showing correlations between numerical features.
Model Results
1.	Confusion Matrix: To evaluate the performance of the Random Forest Classifier.
2.	Top 15 Players: A bar chart showing players ranked by their average performance score.
